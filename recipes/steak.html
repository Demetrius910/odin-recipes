    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 thick-cut beef steaks (such as filet mignon or New York strip)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons whole black peppercorns</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brandy (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh chopped parsley for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Crush Peppercorns</strong>:Start by crushing the whole black peppercorns. You can do this using a mortar and pestle or by placing the peppercorns in a sealed plastic bag and gently crushing them with a kitchen mallet. You want them coarsely crushed, not finely ground.</li>
        <li><strong>Season the Steaks</strong>:Season the steaks generously with salt on both sides, and then press the crushed peppercorns onto both sides of the steaks, ensuring they adhere to the meat.</li>
        <li><strong>Sear the Steaks</strong>: Heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot and shimmering, add the steaks. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side for medium-rare (adjust cooking time for your preferred level of doneness). Remove the steaks from the skillet and set them aside on a warm plate to rest.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Sauce</strong>:In the same skillet, reduce the heat to medium and add the brandy (if using). Be cautious, as it may flame briefly. Allow the brandy to reduce by half, then add the heavy cream and any juices that have accumulated on the plate with the resting steaks. Simmer the sauce until it thickens, stirring occasionally, for about 3-5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish the Sauce</strong>:Stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter to give the sauce a luxurious finish. Season the sauce with salt to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve</strong>: Pour the creamy peppercorn sauce over the rested steaks. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley for a touch of color and flavor.</li>
    </ol>
